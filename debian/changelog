  * Merge changes from Ubuntu (0.4.26-1ubuntu1):

  Add cdbs-edit-patch script; similar to dpatch-edit-patch to edit an
  existing patch or create a new one. Does not yet work with tarball.mk,
  use dbs-edit-patch in this case for now.

  Thanks to Martin Pitt for the script!

      #297269, but we leave it for t-h to close.
    - Don't parse tarballs a gazillon of times to find config.{guess,sub,rpath}
      One shall be enough!

  * Patch from Lo√Øc Minier to cope with simple-patchsys being included
    despite no patches existing.

cdbs (0.4.26-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a nasty conflict between cdbs updating config.* files and patches
    attempting to modify them on their own.

    WARNING:  Other patch systems based on cdbs are susceptible to this
    problem and might need similar modifications to the ones done to
    simple-patchsys.mk.

    In buildcore.mk:
      - Move config.* updates to a separate update-config target.
      - Add reverse-config target that reverts update-config using *.cdbs-orig
      backups.
      - Make sure both update-config and reverse-config always keep a copy of
      the old file, and that such "old" file is in sync with the patch system.
      IOW, the "old" file can either be patched or unpatched and the patch
      system is responsible for tracking its state (just like for other files).
      - Add config.rpath to backup recovery routine.

    In simple-patchsys.mk:
      - Always invoke reverse-config before anything else, and update-config
        after appliing/reverting patches.
      - Add weak dependency on patchutils and use lsdiff to issue a big
        warning if a patch is updating config.* files.
      - Handle debian/stamp-patched properly so that both apply-patches and
        reverse-patches targets are idempotent.

    In dpatch.mk:
      - Always invoke reverse-config before anything else, and update-config
        after appliing/reverting patches.
      - Add weak dependency on patchutils and use lsdiff to issue a big
        warning if a patch is updating config.* files.
      - Assuming that dpatch itself is in charge of idempotency in the
        apply/reverse targets.
      - [OT]: add weak dependency on dpatch.

cdbs (0.4.23-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU (on Jeff's request).
  * Set 0.4.23-1.1 as the minimal version that provides the DEB_AUTO_UPDATE\
    _DEBIAN_CONTROL feature introduced in 0.4.23-1.  (this prevents packages
    that use this feature from migrating to testing before cdbs itself)

 -- Robert Millan <rmh@debian.org>  Tue,  5 Oct 2004 01:30:47 +0200

cdbs (0.4.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Acknowledging: (Closes: #235961, #268483, #265562, #266982, #267254)

  * Apply Robert's patch to generate config's from config.in.
    (Closes: #272758).  Further tweaked to honour debian/control as a 
    target, and to make sure that cdbs doesn't depend on cdbs.

  * Use this new feature in CDBS.

cdbs (0.4.22-1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replace config.{guess,sub} with real files instead of symlinks.
    (Closes: #268483)

 -- Robert Millan <rmh@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Sep 2004 19:53:00 +0200

cdbs (0.4.22-1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Let's try to do it right this time" NMU.
  * Some packages define DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_* variables _after_ including cdbs
    makefiles.  See bug #262295 (last message) for an example.  This is a Bad
    Thing and breaks the compatibility blurb for DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_AUTOMAKE.
    I'm adding Yet Another One compatibility blurb in the actual target.

cdbs (0.4.22-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU (with Jeff's permission).
  * Multiple fixes/improvements to DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_* interface.
    (Closes: #265562)
    - Recognise _ACLOCAL, and deprecate _AUTOMAKE for aclocal updates.
    - Be smarter when looking for autoconf 2.50 or 2.13 command.
    - Recognise _AUTOHEADER.
    - Move "_LIBTOOL = post" case to autotools.mk, where it belongs.
    - Improve config.{guess,sub} replacement code to crawl into the source
      directory replacing every instance.  In addition, use symlinks instead
      of copying, which is faster.
  * Add warnings when DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_* variables are used unconsistently.
    These should become errors after the release. (Closes: #267254)
  * Fix DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_ACLOCAL (formerly &_AUTOMAKE) invocation of m4.
    Thanks Andreas Rottmann.  (Closes: #235961)

    - Apply patch from Robert Millan to add variables for automatically
      rerunning the autotools: DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_LIBTOOL, DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_AUTOMAKE,
      and DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_AUTOCONF.  Beware that these do not have corresponding
      reverse actions in the clean rule.  If you want to avoid your diff being
      bloated, you'll have to use a separate build dir.  (Closes: #217131).

    - Actually set CDBS_VERSION (Closes: #223707)
    - Move dh_installdeb, dh_perl, and dh_shlibdeps into the binary-predeb:: hook.
      This way one can hook stuff after the various postinsts and stuff have been

    - Add DocBook-ized documentation from debacle <debacle@knorke.in-berlin.de>.

    - buildcore.mk: Don't run common-blah rules at entrypoints
      like binary-arch and binary-indep.  They can actually

    - Implement deprecated variables.
    - Start on multi-build stuff.
    - Don't define DEB_MAKE_CHECK_TARGET by default
      (Closes: #203704, #203703, #203610).
    - Quote id -u output (Closes: #203391).
    - Pass variables like CC and CFLAGS to configure (Closes: #202387).
  * Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>:
    - Build-conflict with autoconf older than 2.54 (test 2 and 5 fails
      if autoconf installed but too old).
    - Only provide --host to configure if different from --build, as
      recommended by autotools-dev README.Debian.
    - Conflict with autoconf2.13 for now (it needs different workarounds
      and I don't know of a safe way to distinguish between them).
    - Install Perl modules into first package by default (instead of tmp
      when there's more than one package).
    - Tweak buildcore.mk and makefile.mk to allow patching makefile and
      do reverse-patching after other clean rules.

    - Major refactoring to buildcore.mk and debhelper.mk to fully support
      an arch/indep split.  Now there are -arch and -indep variants of
      most rules, such as common-build.  Please use those
      (or the package-specific rule) if at all possible.  The other variants
      are deprecated.  If you do the same thing for both -arch and -indep
      builds, please see how e.g. autotools.mk implements this.
    - All variables are now set using = or := instead of ?=.  The latter
      encouraged people to set variables before including the makefiles,
      which is wrong.  In almost all cases, you should be setting the
      variables *after* including the makefiles.
    - debhelper.mk now calls dh_installemacsen (Closes: #197935).
    - debhelper.mk now has many more variables of the form DEB_DH_*_ARGS.
    - gnome.mk now calls dh_scrollkeeper if debhelper is used.
    - Split out vars from makefile.mk into makefile-vars.mk.
  * Jeff Bailey <jbailey@debian.org>
    - Various bug fixes
  * Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>
    - Update perlmodule.mk to be in sync with makefile.mk.
    - python-distutils.mk now also handles simpler non-versioned python
      packages.
    - Various small tweaks to perlmodule.mk and python-distutils.mk.

cdbs (0.4.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Revert previous changes to the 'build' target; build now is again
      hardcoded to just depend on build-arch and build-indep.  This is
      in line with policy, ¬ß7.6.
    - Detect python in configure.ac.
    - Add Build-Depends on python-dev (Closes: #197436).
    - Change Maintainer: to <build-common-hackers@lists.alioth.debian.org>.
    - Use $(DEB_DESTDIR) to reference config.status in autotools.mk
      (Closes: #197477).

cdbs (0.4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Make 'build' target by default depend on nothing.
      Add DEB_BUILD_TARGET_DEPENDS variable.
    - Remove obsolete test:: target.
    - Add new common-post-build:: target.  This is used by
      makefile.mk to run checks, using the
      DEB_MAKE_CHECK_TARGET variable.   By default this is
      unset; however, autotools.mk sets it to 'check'.  This
      means check is run by default for autotools.mk using
      packages.  To avoid running the checks, set
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck.
  * Jeff Bailey <jbailey@debian.org>:
    - Various bug fixes and testsuite tweaks.
    - tarball builds now support bzip, bzip2, and zip
    - Can now override which tarballs are unpacked by setting
      DEB_TARBALL

cdbs (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - debhelper.mk now includes a number of common-binary- rules,
      which is handy for hooking on generic stuff not necessarily
      specific to a package.  It now also includes some more
      documentation for the rules.
    - docbookxml.mk now does its changes in pre-build so it's
      actually useful.  Sigh.
    - debhelper.mk now uses test -s to see if documentation files
      have nonzero size before including them (Closes: #197008).
    - examples/python-logging.rules is now actually included.

cdbs (0.4.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Jordi Mallach is watching me" release.

  * Jeff Bailey <jbailey@debian.org>:
    - Add copyright heads to my files.
    - Added regression test suite.  Not called by default.
    - tarball.mk officially here now.  It appears to work.
  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Add copyright headers to most files.
    - Remove direct dependency by autotools.mk on autotools-vars.mk;
      this makes the depgraph look nicer and it doesn't hurt anything.
    - python-distutils.mk actually works now.
    - New: examples/python-logging.rules.
    - Minor cleanups to examples/libgd-graph-perl.rules.
    - Fix --update-rcd-params parameter passed to dh_installinit
      (Closes: #196500).

    - A dependency graph is now included.
    - langcore.mk now correctly includes buildcore.mk.
    - docbookxml.mk now really fixes Docbook files (Closes: #196215)
    - gnome.mk includes docbookxml.mk after autotools.mk, to ensure
      the docbook fixes run after build.
    - simple-patchsys.mk now removes empty files using patch's -E option.
    - debhelper.mk implements DEB_UPDATE_RCD_PARAMS (Closes: #196385)
  * Jeff Bailey <jbailey@debian.org>
    - Support has been added for builddir != srcdir builds.  To use this
      define DEB_BUILDDIR and (optionally) DEB_SRCDIR (Closes: #194539).
