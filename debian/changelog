cdbs (0.4.57) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Have debhelper.mk build-depend on cdbs 0.4.53 or newer for DH v7.
  * Use unversioned build-dependencies when satisfied in oldstable
    (codename "Etch"), except when required by policy (concretely this
    means keep old versioned depenencies for Perl, relax them a bit for
    Python, but drop them for old versions of debhelper, gnulib,
    type-handling, cdbs and patchutils).
  * Adjust gnome.mk to extend build-dependencies after including classes
    which initialize them.
  * Append trunk in Vcs-* stanzas of debian/control, and use viewsvn
    (not vswn) in Vcs-Browser stanza.  Closes: bug#531692.
  * Build-depend on python-all-dev (not python2.4-dev or python2.5-dev),
    and generalize python-distutils tests to try all available versions
    of python.  Closes: bug#525855, thanks to Martin Pitt.
  * Use $(filter ...) instead of $(findstring ...) to extract space-
    separated options from DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS in debian/rules.
  * Fix autotools.mk not completing all dependencies of post-patches
    before doing configure.

cdbs (0.4.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplify logic in autotools, makefile and debhelper snippets:
    $(if A,A,B) -> $(or A,B).
  * Tighten debhelper.mk build-dependency hint for debhelper.  Closes:
    bug#522613, thanks to Adam D. Barratt and Russ Allbery.
  * Fix python-distutils.mk cleanup clashing with dh_clean (dh_clean
    chokes on dirnames containing trailing "-stamp"):
    + Remove stampdir before clean target
    + Use dirname not ending in "-stamp" (and while at it, use dir below
      debian dir to avoid clashing with upstream files)
    Either of above fixes the issue, and closes: bug#521568, thanks to
    Luca Falavigna.
  * Normalize headers to consistently use 1 line per copyright holder,
    one desription and then 1 empty line.
  * Rewrite debian/copyright to follow recent draft of proposed format:
    + Include all copyright holders (not only most project members)
    + Include all licenses (one file is restricted to GPL v2, other ones
      use different but still GPL2-compatible licenses)
    + Refer to centrally stored GPL-2 (not version-less GPL)
    Thanks for lintian for hinting about some of the above.
  * Adapt testsuite to changed packaging format of python-support 0.90.0
    and newer.

cdbs (0.4.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjust buildcore.mk to not rely on specific inclusion order of
    debhelper.mk.  Closes: bug#489430 (for real this time), thanks to
    Martin Koeppe for insisting.
  * Introduce new variable DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGES, and properly
    deprecate DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGE (instead of just dropping it, as
    was done in 0.4.53).  Add NEWS entry.  This closes: bug#521180,
    thanks to Marc Dequènes.
  * Fix distutils tests to use new DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGES.

cdbs (0.4.53) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonas Smedegaard ]
  * Relax python-central build-dependency to >= 0.5.6 in python-distutils
    class (instruction in python policy is only really needed for
    transition of python-central itself, which has now completed).
  * Adjust perlmodule.mk to not rely on specific inclusion order of cdbs
    files.  Closes: bug#489430, thanks to Martin Koeppe.
  * Drop bogus phrase about ordered relation between debhelper.mk and
    perl.mk in documentation.
  * Run dh_pycentral/dh_pysupport before dh_installinit.  Closes:
    bug#494288, thanks to Guido Günther.
  * Add support for debhelper level 7 (debhelper.mk):
    - Add new option DEB_DH_PREP. At levels <= 7 "dh_clean -k" is used
      by default, at newer levels "dh_prep" is used
    - Support level 7 in CDBS_BUILD_DEPENDS
  * Drop support for Python policy v1 from python-distutils.mk:
    - Drop code handling python policy v1
    - Strip no longer supported options DEB_PYTHON_COMPILE_VERSION and
      DEB_PYTHON_PACKAGES_EXCLUDE from documentation
    - Add NEWS entry about the change
  * Make python-distutils.mk only depend on debhelper when actually
    used, and only require special inclusion order when
    DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL is used.
  * Drop use of dh_python from python-distutils.mk:
    - Drop actual dh_python invocation
    - Build-depend unversioned on python-support and python-central (as
      the required versions adopting the functionality of dh_python are
      provided since oldstable), and drop build-dependency on debhelper.
    - Adjust documentation
  * Fix and extend distutils tests to use Python policy v2 against both
    competing implementations.  Build-depend on python-central and
    python-support.

cdbs (0.4.26-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a nasty conflict between cdbs updating config.* files and patches
    attempting to modify them on their own.

    WARNING:  Other patch systems based on cdbs are susceptible to this
    problem and might need similar modifications to the ones done to
    simple-patchsys.mk.

    In buildcore.mk:
      - Move config.* updates to a separate update-config target.
      - Add reverse-config target that reverts update-config using *.cdbs-orig
      backups.
      - Make sure both update-config and reverse-config always keep a copy of
      the old file, and that such "old" file is in sync with the patch system.
      IOW, the "old" file can either be patched or unpatched and the patch
      system is responsible for tracking its state (just like for other files).
      - Add config.rpath to backup recovery routine.

    In simple-patchsys.mk:
      - Always invoke reverse-config before anything else, and update-config
        after appliing/reverting patches.
      - Add weak dependency on patchutils and use lsdiff to issue a big
        warning if a patch is updating config.* files.
      - Handle debian/stamp-patched properly so that both apply-patches and
        reverse-patches targets are idempotent.

    In dpatch.mk:
      - Always invoke reverse-config before anything else, and update-config
        after appliing/reverting patches.
      - Add weak dependency on patchutils and use lsdiff to issue a big
        warning if a patch is updating config.* files.
      - Assuming that dpatch itself is in charge of idempotency in the
        apply/reverse targets.
      - [OT]: add weak dependency on dpatch.

  * Set 0.4.23-1.1 as the minimal version that provides the DEB_AUTO_UPDATE\
    _DEBIAN_CONTROL feature introduced in 0.4.23-1.  (this prevents packages
    that use this feature from migrating to testing before cdbs itself)

cdbs (0.4.22-1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Let's try to do it right this time" NMU.
  * Some packages define DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_* variables _after_ including cdbs
    makefiles.  See bug #262295 (last message) for an example.  This is a Bad
    Thing and breaks the compatibility blurb for DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_AUTOMAKE.

  * NMU (with Jeff's permission).
  * Multiple fixes/improvements to DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_* interface.
    (Closes: #265562)
    - Recognise _ACLOCAL, and deprecate _AUTOMAKE for aclocal updates.
    - Be smarter when looking for autoconf 2.50 or 2.13 command.
    - Recognise _AUTOHEADER.
    - Move "_LIBTOOL = post" case to autotools.mk, where it belongs.
    - Improve config.{guess,sub} replacement code to crawl into the source
      directory replacing every instance.  In addition, use symlinks instead
      of copying, which is faster.
  * Add warnings when DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_* variables are used unconsistently.
    These should become errors after the release. (Closes: #267254)
  * Fix DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_ACLOCAL (formerly &_AUTOMAKE) invocation of m4.

      and DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_AUTOCONF.  Beware that these do not have corresponding
      reverse actions in the clean rule.  If you want to avoid your diff being

      like binary-arch and binary-indep.  They can actually
      have side effects, which isn't what we want if the
      package really doesn't have any indep or arch packages
      (Closes: #207981).

cdbs (0.4.5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - test/udeb1.sh: New udeb test.
    - New variables DEB_ARCH_REGULAR_PACKAGES and DEB_INDEP_REGULAR_PACKAGES.
    - Fix udeb creation rules.
  * Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>
    - Fix DEB_MAKEMAKER_PACKAGE resolving for Perl modules. This closes:
      bug#5361 thanks to Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaker <ilmari@ilmari.org>
      (although intended behaviour was fixed instead of using his proposed
      patch).

cdbs (0.4.5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Jeff Bailey <jbailey@nisa.net>:
    - Make debhelper.mk.in defaults respect $(DEB_SRCDIR) for looking for
      AUTHORS, README, ChangeLog, and other such files.
    - debhelper.mk now installs THANKS if found.
  * Stefan Gybas <sgybas@debian.org>:
    - Added Ant class for Java packages (Closes: #206408)
    - Fixed prerequisites of common-install-arch and common-install-indep in
      buildcore.mk
  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Add Stefan Gybas to AUTHORS.

 -- Jeff Bailey <jbailey@nisa.net>  Tue, 19 Aug 2003 01:03:46 -0400

cdbs (0.4.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Have binary-arch and binary-indep depend on common-binary-arch
      and common-binary-indep, not just common-binary (Closes: #203985).
    - Use a stamp file for building in makefile.mk (Closes: #203271).

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Aug 2003 18:45:33 -0400

cdbs (0.4.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:

cdbs (0.4.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Just run /usr/bin/python if this doesn't appear to be a
      multi-Python-version package (Closes: #199229).
    - Implement deprecated variables.
    - Start on multi-build stuff.
    - Don't define DEB_MAKE_CHECK_TARGET by default
      (Closes: #203704, #203703, #203610).
    - Quote id -u output (Closes: #203391).
    - Pass variables like CC and CFLAGS to configure (Closes: #202387).
  * Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>:
    - Build-conflict with autoconf older than 2.54 (test 2 and 5 fails
      if autoconf installed but too old).
    - Only provide --host to configure if different from --build, as
      recommended by autotools-dev README.Debian.
    - Conflict with autoconf2.13 for now (it needs different workarounds
      and I don't know of a safe way to distinguish between them).
    - Install Perl modules into first package by default (instead of tmp
      when there's more than one package).
    - Tweak buildcore.mk and makefile.mk to allow patching makefile and
      do reverse-patching after other clean rules.

cdbs (0.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Major refactoring to buildcore.mk and debhelper.mk to fully support
      an arch/indep split.  Now there are -arch and -indep variants of
      most rules, such as common-build.  Please use those
      (or the package-specific rule) if at all possible.  The other variants
      are deprecated.  If you do the same thing for both -arch and -indep
      builds, please see how e.g. autotools.mk implements this.
    - All variables are now set using = or := instead of ?=.  The latter
      encouraged people to set variables before including the makefiles,
      which is wrong.  In almost all cases, you should be setting the
      variables *after* including the makefiles.
    - debhelper.mk now calls dh_installemacsen (Closes: #197935).
    - debhelper.mk now has many more variables of the form DEB_DH_*_ARGS.
    - gnome.mk now calls dh_scrollkeeper if debhelper is used.
    - Split out vars from makefile.mk into makefile-vars.mk.
  * Jeff Bailey <jbailey@debian.org>
    - Various bug fixes
  * Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>
    - Update perlmodule.mk to be in sync with makefile.mk.
    - python-distutils.mk now also handles simpler non-versioned python
      packages.
    - Various small tweaks to perlmodule.mk and python-distutils.mk.

cdbs (0.4.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Revert previous changes to the 'build' target; build now is again
      hardcoded to just depend on build-arch and build-indep.  This is
      in line with policy, §7.6.
    - Detect python in configure.ac.
    - Add Build-Depends on python-dev (Closes: #197436).
    - Change Maintainer: to <build-common-hackers@lists.alioth.debian.org>.
    - Use $(DEB_DESTDIR) to reference config.status in autotools.mk
      (Closes: #197477).

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Jun 2003 13:42:55 -0400

cdbs (0.4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Make 'build' target by default depend on nothing.
      Add DEB_BUILD_TARGET_DEPENDS variable.
    - Remove obsolete test:: target.
    - Add new common-post-build:: target.  This is used by
      makefile.mk to run checks, using the
      DEB_MAKE_CHECK_TARGET variable.   By default this is
      unset; however, autotools.mk sets it to 'check'.  This
      means check is run by default for autotools.mk using
      packages.  To avoid running the checks, set
      DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck.
  * Jeff Bailey <jbailey@debian.org>:
    - Various bug fixes and testsuite tweaks.
    - tarball builds now support bzip, bzip2, and zip
    - Can now override which tarballs are unpacked by setting
      DEB_TARBALL

cdbs (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - debhelper.mk now includes a number of common-binary- rules,
      which is handy for hooking on generic stuff not necessarily
      specific to a package.  It now also includes some more
      documentation for the rules.
    - docbookxml.mk now does its changes in pre-build so it's
      actually useful.  Sigh.
    - debhelper.mk now uses test -s to see if documentation files
      have nonzero size before including them (Closes: #197008).
    - examples/python-logging.rules is now actually included.

cdbs (0.4.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Jordi Mallach is watching me" release.

  * Jeff Bailey <jbailey@debian.org>:
    - Add copyright heads to my files.
    - Added regression test suite.  Not called by default.
    - tarball.mk officially here now.  It appears to work.
  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Add copyright headers to most files.
    - Remove direct dependency by autotools.mk on autotools-vars.mk;
      this makes the depgraph look nicer and it doesn't hurt anything.
    - python-distutils.mk actually works now.
    - New: examples/python-logging.rules.
    - Minor cleanups to examples/libgd-graph-perl.rules.
    - Fix --update-rcd-params parameter passed to dh_installinit
      (Closes: #196500).

  * Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>:
    - Package is now Debian-native.
    - A dependency graph is now included.
    - langcore.mk now correctly includes buildcore.mk.
    - docbookxml.mk now really fixes Docbook files (Closes: #196215)
    - gnome.mk includes docbookxml.mk after autotools.mk, to ensure
      the docbook fixes run after build.
    - simple-patchsys.mk now removes empty files using patch's -E option.
    - debhelper.mk implements DEB_UPDATE_RCD_PARAMS (Closes: #196385)
  * Jeff Bailey <jbailey@debian.org>
    - Support has been added for builddir != srcdir builds.  To use this
      define DEB_BUILDDIR and (optionally) DEB_SRCDIR (Closes: #194539).
