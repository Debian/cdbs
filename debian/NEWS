  * autotools-vars.mk now properly sets libexecdir to /usr/lib.

    Previously CDBS set libexecdir to /usr/lib/$pkg, which was wrong and
    now starts causing trouble for recent autotools.  You need to adjust
    your packaging if you relied on the older broken behaviour.

  * Compiler flags are now handled differently in langcore.mk:
  
    + CFLAGS CPPFLAGS CXXFLAGS LDFLAGS and FFLAGS are handled
      (previously only CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS handled).
    + Flags are set only if not locally set or explicitly unset
      (previously always set, extending any local flags).

    To support DEB_*FLAGS_MAINT_* and DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS instead of
    locally set or unset flags, include /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk.

  * Build-dependency autoresolving for debhelper now rely directly on
    debian/compat or DH_COMPAT.  If using a not yet finalized level,
    you will need to explicitly state which version of debhelper is
    acceptable, like this (usable for multistrap support):

      CDBS_BUILD_DEPENDS_rules_debhelper_v9 = debhelper (>= 8.1.3~)

  * Support variables DEB_PYTHON_PRIVATE_MODULES_DIRS_DEFAULT, *_ALL and
    *_<package>.
    Use of DEB_PYTHON_PRIVATE_MODULES_DIRS is now deprecated.

  * DEB_MAKE_DESTDIRSKEL is now respected when flavors are used in
    makefile.mk.  python-autotools.mk continue to install all flavors
    into same destdir, but flavors enabled in different ways now install
    in per-flavor subdirs of the old destdir by default.

  * Python snippets now use packaging systems "python2" and "python3" by
    default, i.e. when DEB_PYTHON_SYSTEM is not set.
    All sensibly-named packages are then affected, unless any of new
    variables DEB_PYTHON2_PACKAGES or DEB_PYTHON3_PACKAGES is set.

    Python packaging systems "pycentral" and "pysupport" are unchanged:
    Only first package affected, unless DEB_PYTHON_PACKAGES is set.

  * Per-package variables in buildcore.mk and debhelper.mk now generally
    use the following scheme:
    + VAR_ALL applies to all packages
    + VAR_<package> applies to current package
    + VAR_DEFAULT applies to current package if VAR_pkg is empty
    Use of VAR without "suffix" for per-package variables is now
    deprecated, except for a few cases marked as TODO in those files.
    Closes: bug#582693, thanks to Rudy Godoy.
  * The following snippets are now deprecated:
    + dpatch.mk
    + simple-patchsys.mk
    + tarball.mk
    + perlmodule-vars.mk
    + perlmodule.mk
    Please use source format 3.0 and perl-makemaker.mk instead.

  * The variable DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGE used in python-distutils.mk
    is now deprecated.  Use new variable DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGES
    instead.

    As its name indicates, the new variable may support multiple Python
    packages in the future.

cdbs (0.4.53) unstable; urgency=low

  python-distutils.mk no longer supports Python policy v1.
  DEB_PYTHON_SYSTEM must now always be set to either of the two
  competing implementations of Python policy v2, pysupport or pycentral.

  To install multiple binaries directly into their package subdir like
  the older routines did, add the following:

    DEB_PYTHON_DESTDIR = $(CURDIR)/debian/$(cdbs_curpkg)
