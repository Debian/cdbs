cdbs (0.4.53) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  python-distutils.mk no longer supports Python policy v1.
  DEB_PYTHON_SYSTEM must now always be set to either of the two
  competing implementations of Python policy v2, pysupport or pycentral.

  To install multiple binaries directly into their package subdir like
  the older routines did, add the following:

    DEB_PYTHON_DESTDIR = $(CURDIR)/debian/$(cdbs_curpkg)
