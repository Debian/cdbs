  * DEB_MAKE_DESTDIRSKEL is now respected when flavors are used in
    makefile.mk.  python-autotools.mk continue to install all flavors
    into same destdir, but flavors enabled in different ways now install
    in per-flavor subdirs of the old destdir by default.

  * Python packaging system "python2" is now supported and used by
    default, i.e. when DEB_PYTHON_SYSTEM is not set.
    All likely packages are then used by default, overridden by new
    variable DEB_PYTHON2_PACKAGES.

    Python packaging systems "pycentral" and "pysupport" are unchanged:
    Only first package used, unless overridden by DEB_PYTHON_PACKAGES.

  * Per-package variables in buildcore.mk and debhelper.mk now generally
    use the following scheme:
    + VAR_ALL applies to all packages
    + VAR_<package> applies to current package
    + VAR_DEFAULT applies to current package if VAR_pkg is empty
    Use of VAR without "suffix" for per-package variables is now
    deprecated, except for a few cases marked as TODO in those files.
    Closes: bug#582693, thanks to Rudy Godoy.
  * The following snippets are now deprecated:
    + dpatch.mk
    + simple-patchsys.mk
    + tarball.mk
    + perlmodule-vars.mk
    + perlmodule.mk
    Please use source format 3.0 and perl-makemaker.mk instead.

  * The variable DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGE used in python-distutils.mk
    is now deprecated.  Use new variable DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGES
    instead.

    As its name indicates, the new variable may support multiple Python
    packages in the future.

  python-distutils.mk no longer supports Python policy v1.
  DEB_PYTHON_SYSTEM must now always be set to either of the two
  competing implementations of Python policy v2, pysupport or pycentral.

  To install multiple binaries directly into their package subdir like
  the older routines did, add the following:

    DEB_PYTHON_DESTDIR = $(CURDIR)/debian/$(cdbs_curpkg)
