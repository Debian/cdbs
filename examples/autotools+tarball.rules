# This example demonstrates how a tarball-based (DBS style) build
# works with CDBS.  When rules/tarball.mk is included, tarballs in the root
# of the package are detected and automatically unpacked. Currently, tarball.mk
# must appear *first* in the list of included makefiles!
#
# Right now, DEB_TAR_SRCDIR has to be defined (It's the directory that is
# unpacked from the tarball).  This will hopefully be eliminated eventually.
