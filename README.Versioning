* Note: for right now, version 1 is subject to incompatible changes.

* The version the user desires has to be explicitly stated
include /usr/share/cdbs/1/class/foo.mk is an explicitly versioned
file.

* Symlinks between unchanged files in versions
For optimization, if a class didn't change between major versions, we
have:
/usr/share/cdbs/2/class/foo.mk -> ../../1/class/foo.mk

* Mixing versions
Should it be safe to mix versions?  Probably not.
