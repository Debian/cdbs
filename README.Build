This package has a lot of Build-Depends; however, not all of them are
necessary for getting a working package.  We have split the Build-Depends
line up.  Everything on the first line is absolutely required for building.
Currently, this is just debhelper.

Everything on the second line is required for auxilliary parts of the
package such as documentation images.

The third line is all the packages required for the various test suites.
